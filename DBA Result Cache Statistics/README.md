# [DBA Result Cache Statistics](https://www.enginatics.com/reports/dba-result-cache-statistics/)
## Description: 
Result cache statistics with size values in MB.

If the 'Maximum Size' is big enough, 'Create Count Failure' should be zero or low, same as 'Delete Count Valid', which depicts the number of valid cache results flushed out.
'Find Count' shows the number of cached results used (instead of executing the underlying sql/plsql) and should hence be as high as possible for maximum performance improvement.

A high number of 'Invalidation Count' or 'Delete Count Invalid' relative to 'Find Count' should get investigated further as it indicates a result_cache specified for code where the underlying data changes too frequently.

We provide an open source Oracle EBS SQLs as a part of operational and project implementation support [toolkits](https://www.enginatics.com/blitz-report-toolkits/) for rapid Excel reports generation. 

[Blitz Report™](https://www.enginatics.com/blitz-report/) is based on Oracle EBS forms technology, and hence requires minimal training. There are no data or performance limitations since the output files are created directly from the database without going through intermediate file formats such as XML. 

Blitz Report can be used as BI Publisher and [Oracle Discoverer replacement tool](https://www.enginatics.com/blog/discoverer-replacement/). Standard Oracle [BI Publisher](https://www.enginatics.com/user-guide/#BI_Publisher) and [Discoverer](https://www.enginatics.com/blog/importing-discoverer-worksheets-into-blitz-report/) reports can also be imported into Blitz Report for immediate output to Excel. Typically, reports can be created and version tracked within hours instead of days. The concurrent request output automatically opens upon completion without the need for re-formatting.
